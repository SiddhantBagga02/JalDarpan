## Project Overview

Accurate forecasting of water demand is essential to ensure efficient and equitable distribution of water resources. This project focuses on leveraging historical, environmental, and real-time sensor data to predict water consumption patterns using machine learning techniques. It aims to address challenges related to water scarcity, operational inefficiencies, and environmental conservation.

## Objectives

The main goals of the project are:

1. Predict short-term and long-term water demand using historical and real-time data.
2. Optimize water distribution networks by aligning supply with demand forecasts.
3. Support sustainable resource use and reduce wastage.
4. Increase resilience to climate-related disruptions.
5. Minimize financial risks and operational costs.
6. Foster trust through reliable and transparent predictions.

## Methodology

The system uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to process sequential time-series data for demand forecasting. The process includes:

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Time-series windowing
- Model training and evaluation
- Real-time prediction dashboard deployment using Flask and Plotly

## Data Sources and Preprocessing

**Data Types Used:**

- Historical water consumption records
- Weather variables (rainfall, humidity, temperature)
- Population and socio-economic data
- Seasonal trends
- IoT and sensor-based real-time water usage data

**Preprocessing Steps:**

- Handling missing values with imputation
- Normalization using MinMaxScaler
- Feature engineering (e.g., demand per capita, seasonal demand ratios)
- Time-series formatting for sequence input

## Model Architecture

The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network optimized for time-series data:

- Two LSTM layers with 100 neurons each
- Dense output layers
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Epochs: 100
- Batch size: 16

The model was trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%.

## Deployment

An interactive web dashboard is built using Flask and Plotly. It allows users to:

- Upload new data
- Visualize real-time predictions
- Compare predicted vs actual consumption

## Results and Visualizations

- Plots show close alignment between actual and predicted water demand values.
- Training and validation loss graphs indicate model convergence.
- Groundwater level trends, dam storage capacity, and seasonal availability are visualized for regions like Sehore, Madhya Pradesh.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional features like temperature and population projections.
- Experiment with alternative models (e.g., GRU, Transformer networks).
- Deploy the system on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) for scalability.
- Perform hyperparameter optimization using automated search methods.
